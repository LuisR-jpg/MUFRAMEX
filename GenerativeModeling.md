# Introduction to generative modelling

###### Lecture 2: VAEs, NFs, GANs

## What's generative modelling

A general approach

- Start from an *easy-to-sample*

- Choose a noise distribution 

- Define a mapping 'g'

## Applications

### Nowcasting

Application in meteorology.

- Prediction of rain in the next 2 hours.

### Protein folding

Application in computational biology.

- Amino-acid sequence to 3D structure.
