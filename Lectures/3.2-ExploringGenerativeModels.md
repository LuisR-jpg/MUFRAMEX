# Exploring deep generative models

###### Lecture 3.1

## Score-based generative models

### Energy-based models

We need to parameterise an energy function. Trying this leads to a nasty estimation problem.

*Langevin Dynamics* give us an easy way to sample from such a distribution. 

### Score matching

### Discrete-time diffusion process

## Continuous score-based models

## Variational perspective

## Active research directions
