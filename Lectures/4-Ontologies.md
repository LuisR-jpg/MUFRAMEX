# Ontologies for describing data

###### Lecture 4

## Why describing data? 

    We have super valuable data, but we need to understand it.

### Levels of **understanding**

- *Data*: Raw element of a reality.

- *Information*: Data and its context.

- *Knowledge*: Background rules enabling deduction/reasoning on collected information.

### Logic

## Ontologies for describing data

Ontologies define useful vocabularies to describe resources. 

The entities of the ontologies have IRIs(?) allowing access to their description for ppl and machines.

### What do we have in an ontology? 

- Labels (terms or symbols)

- Classes (notions, events, states, set of objects)

- Relations between classes

    - Hierarchy of classes

    - Properties

- More axioms

### IRIs

IRIs are identifiers on the web for specific data.

## Ontologies as models to generate new data

    Web of data is the generation of data.

### Different ways to represent knowledge

#### RDF Schemas

It defines

- Classes of resources

- Their properties

- Organize their hierarchies

#### OWL - The Web Ontology Language

### Resources 

#### LOV 

Is a webpage that provides an already made ontology.

#### Schema.org

Used by big companies like microsoft, google and yahoo.

#### FOAF (friend of a friend)

#### DBPedia Ontology

Ontology created manually with the resources that are described in wikipedia

#### SSN/SOSA

Ontology to describe activity of things that have to do with sensors

## Conclusion

- Ontologies help making data reusable

- Help making some information explicit

- Great solution to proviede quality data for ML approaches.
