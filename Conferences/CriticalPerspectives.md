# Critical perspectives on AI development

## How did we get here?

### Computer vision

#### Make an AI that identifies cats

- You need a lot of images of cats and no cats.

- Once you have the data:

    - What is the relationship between labels and images? 

#### Facial recognition and Science of emotions

- Science of emotions is what used to try to explain the emotions. It turned out to be wrong and emotion are a mere cultural thing.

- There's a dataset: The japanese female facial expression.

- Another dataset: Imagenet

    To work on this, a competiton was kicked off and the winner is known to be the first success case of deep learning.

#### Problems about this

- Labelling people is not ok

- Are the labels correct? 

- People keep trying to describe physical and emotional characteristicts just by facial recognition.

- AI is a new form of scientific racism, sexism and clasism.

## What drives this technology development

### Key factors

- Algorithmic innovation

- Data 

- Computing used for training

### Costs

#### Alpha GO

- It costed 35 million USD

- An hour costed over 1000 USD

## Where we are

- Centralization of power

- Dedemocratization of AI

- Increase of environmental impacts

### Deep generative models

#### Deepfakes genesis

The use of deepfakes is nasty.

Serious case of fabrication of evidence

#### Pegasus

Malware sold to government. Mexican has bought it.

It steals data and has been used the most in Mexico for human right activists and journalist.

#### Guacamaya leaks

Pointed out that journalists and environmental activists are in danger in Mexico
