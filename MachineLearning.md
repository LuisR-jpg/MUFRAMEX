# Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1. Introduction

### Machine learning

**Systems that learn to solve a problem from data and experience.**

The goal is to optimize a function that we don't know completely (because we usually have a sample only).

    If you're able to understand the difference between two or more things, you'll be able to predict an unknown one.


#### In ML we're interested in *optimality* and *quality*.

    That is, we want the data to look like a normal distribution.

#### TODO: Insert here some notation and terminology

#### Errors and errors

    When trying to get a curve that fits our point, we can face underfitting or overfitting, which is not good.

**Ways to achieve classification/regression**

### Nearest neighbor and KNN

Decide by voting (classification) or averaging (regression) what neighborhood a point in the space belongs to.

This is achieved by looking to the k closest neighbors.
